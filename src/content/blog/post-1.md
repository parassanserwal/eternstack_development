In the labyrinthine world of academia, where students often encounter countless challenges, Akshit Dandyan, a B.Tech student, discovered a glaring gap during his first year. The university's ERP system was ridden with issues—abysmal user interface, lack of notifications, and inadequate data storage. Recognizing the need for a transformation, Akshit embarked on a remarkable journey that would eventually lead to the birth of EternStack.

#### The Genesis - First Year Exploration

Akshit's journey began with a critical observation. The ERP system in his university was outdated and inefficient. Being a student passionate about technology, he couldn't ignore the problems plaguing the system. During his first year, he delved into understanding the intricacies of ERP systems and their potential to streamline operations.

#### Research and Skill Development - The Second Year Leap

In his second year, Akshit decided to take matters into his own hands. He dedicated himself to researching ERP systems and learning the skills required to develop a solution. As knowledge accumulated, he decided to assemble a team of like-minded individuals who shared his vision for a better university experience.

#### Invention of CSE CREW

Akshit's vision resonated with his peers. He recruited four students who shared his enthusiasm for improving the ERP system. Together, they began collecting data to create a new and improved system, naming it as CSE CREW. Students were delighted with the prospects of a more user-friendly and efficient system.

##### From Web to PWA - Enhancing User Experience

The team's relentless efforts paid off when they transformed their creation into a Progressive Web App (PWA). The transition to a PWA significantly enhanced the user experience and allowed access to a broader audience. This pivotal decision laid the foundation for what was to come.

##### Premium Features and Revenue Generation**
Eight months after the inception of their venture, the team was ready to take a giant leap. They introduced premium features available at a nominal price of ₹56 for one month and ₹146 for three months. Their fellow students didn't hesitate to subscribe to these services. Within three months, their revenue reached a staggering ₹30,000, a testament to their dedication and the value they were providing.

##### Incubation and Startup Registration
As they continued to expand their product line, the team ventured into their university's incubation center, designed for startup evaluations. This marked a pivotal moment as they discussed the process of registering their startup. With the support of investors and the guidance of "Startup India," a government organization fostering startups in India, they officially registered their company as EternStack.

##### Product Portfolio Expansion
With EternStack's official registration, the team was poised for exponential growth. They worked tirelessly to develop and launch several products, including MOCKANAPI, CSE Crew, BearThisNews, UpdateBox, and more. Each product aimed to address specific issues and enhance user experiences across various domains.

##### Looking Forward - A Vision for the Future
Akshit Dandyan and Paras Sanserwal, the founders of EternStack, recognize that the journey is far from over. They continue to work on enhancing their products and expanding their reach. EternStack's success story is a testament to the power of passion, dedication, and the impact a group of determined students can have on the world.

##### A New Member Joins the Team
On this journey of transformation, one notable event stands out. Chesta Agnihotri, a Third year CSE student, approached the founders, seeking an internship position. Recognizing her potential and passion, the founders agreed. Chesta became an invaluable part of the EternStack team, contributing her skills, insights, and perspectives.
